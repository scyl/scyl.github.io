          <h3>Background</h3>
          <h5>My Computing Life</h4>
	        <p>My first real experience with programming was in 2010. 
          I was made known of a university first year computing course that I could complete while I was still in school. 
          It was HS1917. Not only was the lectures interesting, I found programming to be very fun and rewarding, working my way around problems was challenging and yet I enjoyed it a lot. 
          Through out the course, I also met a lot of wonderful people that I still talk to and hang out with.
          I learnt a lot of how programming is like in the course, but more importantly, I learnt that programming is something I want to do and by the end of the course, I have decided that this is something I want to study in university. 
          Also as a result of how much the course meant for me, I decided that I want to help share this experience to other people as well, which is why I mentored HS1917 for so many years after that.</p>
          <h5>My Digital Media Life</h4>
          <p>I had my first experience with digital media in 2007 in school. As part of wood work, we had to create a 3D model of a simple bridge in Google SketchUp.
          It captured my interest immediately and introduced me to the world of CGI. As a result of that, I did Multimedia in school every year since.
          I taught myself AfterEffects from online tutorials and really enjoyed it. 
          While there isn't many AfterEffects heavy projects I needed to do for university, I was able to apply my skills through creating videos for my Church.</p>
